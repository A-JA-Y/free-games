## üö® Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues
The application may encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when accessing external APIs from certain environments. This is a common limitation when making API calls from browser-based applications.

**Solutions:**
- For development: Use a CORS proxy or browser extension
- For production: Deploy to a server that can handle CORS headers
- Alternative: Implement a backend proxy service

### Performance Considerations
- Images are loaded dynamically and may take time to appear on slower connections
- The application loads 21 games initially and uses pagination for optimal performance
